# Maze-Game
Description
Maze Solver is a simple Java application that allows users to visualize and solve mazes using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and A* algorithm. The application provides a graphical interface using swing tools where users can interact with the maze, set random start and end points, changeable walls and open walls and observe the algorithm solving the maze.

Features
•	Generate random mazes
•	Set start and end points
•	Solve mazes using DFS and A* algorithms
•	Adjustable speed for solving the maze
•	Reset maze functionality

Installation
1.	Download 
2.	Open the project in your Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3.	Compile and run the `maze.java` file to start the application.

Usage
•	Upon launching the application, you will see the maze grid displayed on the screen.
•	Click on the "Solve Maze" button to start solving the maze using DFS and A* algorithms. DFS provide all the functionalities like speed and reset though A* algorithm needs improvement.
•	Adjust the speed of the solving process by clicking on the "Speed" button and selecting the desired speed.
•	To reset the maze, click on the "Reset Maze" button.
•	You can also click on individual cells in the maze to toggle them between walls and open paths.
